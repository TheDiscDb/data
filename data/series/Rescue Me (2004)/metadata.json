Three years later and his life is in shambles and an everyday struggle not to take a drink. Between spying on (\u0026amp; trying to get back with) his separated wife and 3 kids, the growing sexual tension between him and Jimmy\u0027s widow, his father and uncle\u0027s erratic behavior and the antics of his crew, Tommy\u0027s (Irish) anger and need to drink is at a tipping point - and now his survivor\u0027s guilt is making him see and talk to dead people, particularly his cousin Jimmy. All these personal demons are threatening what he holds most dear - the inherent courage and pride it means to be a member of the perpetual boy\u0027s club of the F.D.N.Y.",
