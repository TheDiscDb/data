With that added pressure, he hopes to put in a good showing at the football where he is placekicker. Unfortunately, Lucy is supposed to hold the ball for him.. It\u0027s homecoming night, and Charlie Brown is not only the escort for the homecoming queen (which happens to be the red-haired girl he\u0027s been drooling over for goodness knows how long), he is also the kicker for the school\u0027s football team (and Lucy\u0027s the holder. Need I say more?) Despite a certain person\u0027s old habit that won\u0027t die young, Charlie brown is blamed for their team\u0027s loss, but he ends up becoming the life of the homecoming dance. However, we never see it, and Charlie Brown doesn\u0027t remember it, which brings the question; did it really happen?",
