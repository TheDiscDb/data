  "Plot": "Kindhearted Griffin Keyes is one of the best-loved caretakers at the Franklin Park Zoo, but he\u0027s more comfortable with the animals than with females of his own species as proven by his failed marriage proposal to the self-absorbed Stephanie several years ago. The animals have listened to Griffin pine over her for years and, after she reappears in his life, they decide to help Griffin rekindle the relationship and become the alpha male she wants him to be. They inadvertently reveal their secret ability to talk and, after Griffin\u0027s initial shock, teach him the rules of courtship, animal-style. Surprisingly, the animals\u0027 advice really works and Griffin is about to get everything he\u0027s ever dreamed of--or is he?",
  "Tagline": "Don\u0027t talk to the animals...unless they talk to you first.",
