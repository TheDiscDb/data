The lovable, confident, tough, furry blue behemoth-like giant monster named James P. Sullivan (better known as Sulley) and his wisecracking best friend, short, green cyclops monster Mike Wazowski, discover what happens when the real world interacts with theirs in the form of a 2-year-old baby girl dubbed \u0022Boo,\u0022 who accidentally sneaks into the monster world with Sulley one night. And now it\u0027s up to Sulley and Mike to send Boo back in her door before anybody finds out, especially two evil villains such as Sulley\u0027s main rival as a scarer, chameleon-like Randall (a monster that Boo is very afraid of), who possesses the ability to change the color of his skin, and Mike and Sulley\u0027s boss Mr. Waternoose, the chairman and chief executive officer of Monsters, Inc.",
