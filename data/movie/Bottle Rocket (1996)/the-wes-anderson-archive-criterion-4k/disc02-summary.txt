Description: Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson wrote the first draft of a screenplay together when they were students at the University of Texas at Austin. A year later, in 1992, with four thousand dollars borrowed from their fathers, they started shooting their 16 mm black-and-white feature. They ran out of money after producing about eight minutes of the film. They showed that to the Wilson family friend and screenwriter L. M. Kit Carson, who raised enough additional money to expand the movie to about thirteen minutes. They submitted that to the Sundance Film Festival, where it was shown as a short in 1993. Here is the original Bottle Rocket short, which convinced Hollywood to take a chance on a group of enthusiastic, unknown young filmmakers.
