  "Plot": "Walter Fielding and Anna Crowley must start looking for a new house--but they can\u0027t afford much. This changes when they meet a lonely con artist who sells the a beautiful mansion at a ridiculously-low price. The catch: the second they move into the house, it falls apart, starting with the stairway collapsing, to the bathtub falling through the floor, to the chimney eventually falling into the house. Finally, they must renovate the house before the frame collapses, but the renovations also prove disastrous.",
