Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone), and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents\u0027 disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father\u0027s former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors\u0027 alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.",
