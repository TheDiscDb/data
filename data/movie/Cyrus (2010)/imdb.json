  "Plot": "With John\u0027s social life at a standstill and his ex-wife about to get remarried, a down on his luck divorc\u00E9 finally meets the woman of his dreams, only to discover she has another man in her life - her son. Still single seven years after the breakup of his marriage, John has all but given up on romance. But at the urging of his ex-wife and best friend Jamie, John grudgingly agrees to join her and her fianc\u00E9 Tim at a party. To his and everyone else\u0027s surprise, he actually manages to meet someone: the gorgeous and spirited Molly. Their chemistry is immediate. The relationship takes off quickly but Molly is oddly reluctant to take the relationship beyond John\u0027s house. Perplexed, he follows her home and discovers the other man in Molly\u0027s life: her son, Cyrus. A 21-year-old new age musician, Cyrus is his mom\u0027s best friend and shares an unconventional relationship with her. Cyrus will go to any lengths to protect Molly and is definitely not ready to share her with anyone, especially John. ...",
