Description: The making of I Am Cuba was as epic in scope as the film itself. This 2004 documentary, directed by Vicente Ferraz, is a thorough exploration of that process, from the arrival of Soviet filmmakers Mikhail Kalatozov and Sergei Urusevsky in Havana to the movie's years-long production — and tepid reception — and its international rediscovery in the 1990s. It features interviews with key participants and rare behind-the-scenes footage.
